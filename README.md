## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. And the Jupyter notebook, I'm using the version 6.1.4 of the notebook server.

### The librery used in this project:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using physicochemical data of wine from 2009 to start to understand:

- What is the ratio of all wines evalued?
- What is the main property that influences for high quality?
- Does wine with high ABV mean high quality?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The dataset is related to red wine, which contains only physicochemical and sensory variables.

Physicochemical variables:

1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol

Sensory variable:

12. quality (score between 0 and 10)


## Results<a name="results"></a>
The analysis of the results can be found at the post available [here](https://fernando-nici.medium.com/a-brief-look-at-physicochemical-and-sensory-variables-to-measure-red-wine-quality-af2b12eeace4).
